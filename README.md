# SOC Threat Analysis Lab

This project simulates the role of a junior SOC Threat Analyst by focusing on
Windows endpoint telemetry, attacker behavior analysis, alert triage, and
detection gap identification.

The lab uses a Windows 11 endpoint and a Linux-based SIEM to analyze real
security logs, investigate suspicious activity, and document analyst decisions
using MITRE ATT&CK.

This repository emphasizes analyst thinking, investigation methodology, and
detection reasoning rather than tool-driven alert generation.
